# WHOIS

WHOIS functions as the "white pages" for domain names, operating through a TCP-based query/response protocol on TCP port 43. It offers access to databases containing domain names, IPs, and autonomous systems, providing information to Internet users.


Running a WHOIS lookup on a target yields details such as registrar info, creation date, expiry, and registrant contact information. This information, while not sufficient for an attack, is crucial for reference and future use.
