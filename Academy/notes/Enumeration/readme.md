# Enumeration
>information gathering using active (scans) and passive (use of third-party providers) methods

Our goal is not to get at the systems but to find all the ways to get there.
 - What can we see?
 - What reasons can we have for seeing it?
 - What image does what we see create for us?
 - What do we gain from it?
 - How can we use it?
 - What can we not see?
 - What reasons can there be that we do not see?
 - What image results for us from what we do not see?

Our core task is not to exploit the machines but to find how they can be exploited
